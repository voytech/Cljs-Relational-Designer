# Cljs-Relational-Designer

Clojurescript library/framework for developing different kinds of diagrams.  
Key functionalities:
- Support for different kind of entities (diagram entity classes) via DSL 
- Creating relationships between entities
- Behaviours - native event handling leveraged to application events model (via core.async and simple event-bus)
- Auto-wiring of behaviours (Subject to change)
- Support for custom rendering engines
- SVG renderer engine
- Canvas renderer engine (using fabric.js)
- Pluggable architecture via event bus and loose coupling of modules.
- First class building blocks represeted using macros: defentity, defcomponent, defbehaviour, deflayout and so on

## Dependencies

- java 1.8+
- [boot][1]

## Architecture 



## Usage
Cljs-Relation-Designer has many display components already present for consumers:

e.g.
```clojure
(defcomponent relation :draw-line {} (relation-initializer))
```

where:

'relation' - is a component, a component simply groups display properties for shape and gives it a namespace qualified name. 

':draw-line' - is a rendering method dispatching key. Many shapes with similar display properties may be rendered differently. E.g. clircle may have following properties: left, top, width, height. On the other hand, rectangle may have the same set of properties too. Rendering method helps to choose right rendering logic for particular component type. 

'relation-initializer' - is function as follows: 

```clojure
(defn- relation-initializer []
 (fn [container props]
   {:x1  0
    :y1  0
    :x2 (-> container :size :width)
    :y2 0
    :left 0
    :top 0
    :border-color "black"
    :border-style :solid
    :border-width 1
    :z-index :before-bottom}))
```
'realtion-initializer' is a display property map generator for late evaluation - at time when component becomes child of an entity. First argument of realtion-initializer is an owning entity. Reason why relation-initializer is a lazy property-map evaluator is that sometimes it may be required to know some properties of entities in order to correctly display specific component. 

Component means nothing without an entity, and it can only be displayed after being attached as an entity child.

This is how entity definition looks like: 

```clojure
(defentity association
  {:width 180 :height 150}
  (with-layouts
    (layout :attributes l/default-flow-layout (cl/having-layout-property :attributes) relation-layout-options))
  (components-templates
    (component-template ::c/relation {:border-width 3}))
  (with-components data options
    (component c/relation "connector" {} {})
    (component c/startpoint "start" {} {})
    (component c/arrow "arrow" {} {})
    (component c/endpoint "end" {} {})
    (component c/title "title" {:text "Title."} {:layout :attributes})))
```

And this is how to render this entity on DOM element: 

```clojure
(association app-state options)
```

where app-state is an application state ( will be explained ) and options are usually coordinates {:left ... :top ...}  relative to enclosing DOM element.
